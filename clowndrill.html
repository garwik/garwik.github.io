  <h1>So. Ready for them? The games are. Some'm came out already, lot of the ones lookin for. Persona 5? New game? Lot of games coming out they already have them. Some of them, they don't tell you, what came out before. It comes out and they, they say it. They don't tell you after. Later its coming out its already out already. They don't remind you what's uh what games are out. Persona 5? Lot of Japan got angry.

  It was about a month ago but in Japan they had 'er already but even two years ago they said... it would come out and its

  Now the one PS4, PSVR, PS More. There's an extra theres a bigger PlayStation get more graphics more lines of graphics in there. Persona 5? Which brings me to my next question.

  Nother games? Coming out? Try on the XBox. If they, if you check this month, out of XBox, lotta big plans, don't they say? PC? Don't forget em. They have all of them this month. All the ones coming out will be in it. Every month, its only what's coming out for that month. If they have to delay it, they don't do it until it's in the month its coming out. It's like a Genesis NES cartridge system.

  They made a new Nintendo. Took it away. It's only usually only new games coming out. They make em, they're released, they don't have old games come out. Games already made if its coming out its new. So, look for it: Persona foihe

  Nother big announcement. The games stage, they present em. They get they probably wont. Alright. Gamers check the sun to play em up high. If you ever fuck up, do bad, check, re-in the game you start up again you go again. So most the time they... they're alright.ï»¿</h1>
